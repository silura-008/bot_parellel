    - It dulls the pain
    - Yes, once I even deleted my account because I was so nervous about down votes. Lately,every once in a while I comment encouraging good attitude.

    - [NAME] has to lose it a some point, just hope it's not tonight.
    - The impact of his head hitting the court looked so bad. I hope he'll recover from this.
    - I think [NAME] could've been a long term quality backup. We really should have hung onto him and ejected [NAME] like a bad habit.

    - It's like you didn't even read the comment you're responding to.
    - I know I don't know the Spanish alphabet but I can't believe I didn't catch that before
    - He sunk their house into the ground and blamed the architect and every episoode after that his beard gets a little less washed ü§î
    - Oh right I forgot [NAME] was on the show
    - This is the sort of chucklefuck who finds himself saying "and there was nothing I could do" after a mishap... often.
